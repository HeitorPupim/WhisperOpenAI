Nikola Tesla sees a wireless vision by Anonymous, the New York Times, 3rd October, 1915.

00:09.880 --> 00:11.920
This is a LibriVox recording.

00:11.920 --> 00:14.920
All LibriVox recordings are in the public domain.

00:20.200 --> 00:23.760
Nikola Tesla sees a wireless vision.

00:23.760 --> 00:29.080
Things his world system will allow hundreds to talk at once through the Earth.

00:29.080 --> 00:31.760
Trans-static disturbance.

00:31.760 --> 00:37.480
Inventor hopes also to transmit pictures by the same medium which carries the voice.

00:37.480 --> 00:43.880
Nikola Tesla announced to the Times last night that he had received a patent on an invention

00:43.880 --> 00:50.320
which would not only eliminate static interference, the present bugaboo of wireless telephony,

00:50.320 --> 00:55.520
but would enable thousands of persons to talk at once between wireless stations and make

00:55.520 --> 01:01.920
it possible for those talking to see one another by wireless regardless of the distance separating

01:01.920 --> 01:02.920
them.

01:02.920 --> 01:08.120
He said also that with his wireless station, now in the process of construction on Long

01:08.120 --> 01:13.960
Island, he hoped to make New York one of the central exchanges in a world system of

01:13.960 --> 01:16.360
wireless telephony.

01:16.360 --> 01:20.640
Mr. Tesla has been working on wireless problems for many years.

01:20.640 --> 01:26.960
Yesterday he exhibited an article published in the Electrical World 11 years ago in which

01:26.960 --> 01:32.120
he predicted not only wireless telephony on a commercial basis, but that it would be possible

01:32.120 --> 01:36.760
to identify the voice of an acquaintance over any distance.

01:36.760 --> 01:41.880
That its operator in Hawaii was able to distinguish the voice of an engineer friend at Arlington,

01:41.880 --> 01:47.800
Virginia, was announced by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company as the most marked triumph

01:47.800 --> 01:53.040
of its communication by wireless telephone from the Naval radio station at Arlington

01:53.040 --> 01:58.000
to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, a distance of 4,000 miles.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.520
The inventor, who has won fame by his electrical inventions, dictated this statement yesterday.

02:04.520 --> 02:09.360
The experts carrying out this brilliant experiment are naturally deserving of great credit for

02:09.360 --> 02:13.000
the skill they have shown in perfecting the devices.

02:13.000 --> 02:18.880
These are of two kinds, first, those serving to control transmission, and second, those

02:18.880 --> 02:21.480
magnifying the received impulse.

02:21.480 --> 02:27.280
That the control of transmission is perfect is plain to experts, from the fact the Arlington,

02:27.280 --> 02:32.960
Maryland, and Pearl Harbor plants are all inefficient, and that the distance of telephonic

02:32.960 --> 02:37.480
transmission is equal to that of telegraphic transmission.

02:37.480 --> 02:42.960
It is also perfectly apparent that the chief merit of the application lies in the magnification

02:42.960 --> 02:45.640
of the microphonic impulse.

02:45.640 --> 02:49.760
It must not be imagined that we deal here with new discoveries.

02:49.760 --> 02:54.280
The improvement simply concerns the control of the transmitted and the magnification of

02:54.280 --> 02:58.640
the received impulse, but the wireless system is the same.

02:58.640 --> 03:00.760
This can never be changed.

03:00.760 --> 03:06.120
That it is practicable to project the human voice not only to a distance of 5,000 miles,

03:06.120 --> 03:12.560
but clear across the globe, I demonstrated by experiments in Colorado in 1899.

03:12.560 --> 03:18.480
Among my publications, I would refer to an article in the electrical world of March 5,

03:18.480 --> 03:23.760
1904, but describing really tests I made in 1899.

03:23.760 --> 03:28.680
The facts which I pointed out in the article were of much greater significance than that

03:28.680 --> 03:34.000
of the experiments reported, although this should be taken in a scientific sense, as

03:34.000 --> 03:37.760
the experiments were simply scientific demonstrations.

03:37.760 --> 03:42.640
I pointed out then that the modulations of the human voice can be reproduced more clearly

03:42.640 --> 03:45.260
through the earth than through wire.

03:45.260 --> 03:50.320
It is difficult for the layman to understand, but it is an absolute fact that transmission

03:50.320 --> 03:54.360
through the earth with a proper apparatus is not more difficult than the sending of

03:54.360 --> 03:57.600
a message on a wire strung across a room.

03:57.600 --> 04:02.040
This wonderful property of the planet, that, electrically speaking, is through its very

04:02.040 --> 04:08.320
bigness small, is of incalculable significance for the future of mankind.

04:08.320 --> 04:13.960
These tests made between Washington and Honolulu will act as an immense stimulus to wireless

04:13.960 --> 04:18.920
telephony and would be of much more value to the world if the principles of the transmission

04:18.920 --> 04:22.080
were understood, but they are not.

04:22.080 --> 04:26.560
Even now, fifteen years after the fundamental principles have been demonstrated and the

04:26.560 --> 04:31.040
possibility shown, there are many experts in the dark.

04:31.040 --> 04:37.280
For instance, it is claimed that static disturbances will fatally interfere with the transmission,

04:37.280 --> 04:42.520
while, as a matter of fact, there is no static disturbance possible in properly designed

04:42.520 --> 04:45.600
transmission and receiving circuits.

04:45.600 --> 04:50.720
Quite recently I have described in a patent circuits which are absolutely immune to static

04:50.720 --> 04:56.440
and other interferences, so much so that when a telephone is attached, there is absolute

04:56.440 --> 05:03.000
silence, even lightning in the immediate vicinity not producing a click of the diaphragm, while

05:03.000 --> 05:08.560
in the ordinary telephonic conversation there are all kinds of noises.

05:08.560 --> 05:13.240
Transmission without static interference has many wonderful properties besides, first of

05:13.240 --> 05:19.320
which is that unlimited amounts of power can be transmitted with very small loss.

05:19.320 --> 05:24.160
Another contention is that there can be no secrecy in wireless telephone conversation.

05:24.160 --> 05:29.840
I say it is absurd to raise this contention when it is positively demonstrated by experiments

05:29.840 --> 05:35.040
that the earth is more suitable for transmission than any wire could ever be.

05:35.040 --> 05:39.800
A wireless telephone conversation can be made as secret as thought.

05:39.800 --> 05:44.600
I have myself erected a plant for the purpose of connecting by wireless telephone the chief

05:44.600 --> 05:50.320
centers of the world, and from this plant, as many as a hundred, will be able to talk

05:50.320 --> 05:54.800
absolutely without interference and with absolute secrecy.

05:54.800 --> 06:00.120
This plant would simply be connected with a telephone central exchange of New York City,

06:00.120 --> 06:05.920
and any subscriber will be able to talk to any other telephone subscriber in the world,

06:05.920 --> 06:09.400
and all this without any change in the apparatus.

06:09.400 --> 06:12.360
This plan has been called my world system.

06:12.360 --> 06:18.560
By the same means, I propose also to transmit pictures and project images so that the subscriber

06:18.560 --> 06:23.600
will not only hear the voice, but see the person to whom he is talking.

06:23.600 --> 06:28.760
Pictures transmitted over wires is a perfectly simple art practiced today.

06:28.760 --> 06:34.720
Many inventors have labored on it, but the chief credit is due Professor Korn of Munich.

06:34.720 --> 06:39.840
His apparatus can be attached to a wireless plant, and at any other wireless plant can

06:39.840 --> 06:41.440
be reproduced.

06:41.440 --> 06:46.220
I have undertaken this in the hope of establishing a service which would greatly facilitate the

06:46.220 --> 06:47.840
work of the press.

06:47.840 --> 06:52.700
A picture could be sent from a battlefield in Europe to New York in five minutes if the

06:52.700 --> 06:55.520
proper instruments were available.

06:55.520 --> 07:01.080
A further advantage would be that transmission is instant and free of the unavoidable delay

07:01.080 --> 07:04.480
experienced with the use of wires and cables.

07:04.480 --> 07:08.880
As I have already made known, the current passes through the earth, starting from the

07:08.880 --> 07:14.080
transmission station with infinite speed, slowing down to the speed of light at a distance

07:14.080 --> 07:19.880
of 6,000 miles, then increasing in speed from that region, and reaching the receiving station

07:19.880 --> 07:22.960
again with infinite velocity.

07:22.960 --> 07:25.160
It's all a wonderful thing.

07:25.160 --> 07:30.520
Wireless is coming to mankind in its full meaning like a hurricane some of these days.

07:30.520 --> 07:36.120
Some day there will be, say, six great wireless telephone stations in a world system connecting

07:36.120 --> 07:42.080
all the inhabitants on this earth to one another, not only by voice, but by sight.

07:42.080 --> 07:45.240
It's surely coming.

07:45.240 --> 07:50.940
End of Nikola Tesla sees a wireless vision by Anonymous, The New York Times, 3rd October

07:50.940 --> 08:13.840
1915.
