5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,760
Nikola Tesla sees a wireless vision.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,080
Things his world system will allow hundreds to talk at once through the Earth.

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,760
Trans-static disturbance.

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,480
Inventor hopes also to transmit pictures by the same medium which carries the voice.

9
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:43,880
Nikola Tesla announced to the Times last night that he had received a patent on an invention

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:50,320
which would not only eliminate static interference, the present bugaboo of wireless telephony,

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,520
but would enable thousands of persons to talk at once between wireless stations and make

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,920
it possible for those talking to see one another by wireless regardless of the distance separating

13
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,920
them.

14
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,120
He said also that with his wireless station, now in the process of construction on Long

15
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,960
Island, he hoped to make New York one of the central exchanges in a world system of

16
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,360
wireless telephony.

17
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,640
Mr. Tesla has been working on wireless problems for many years.

18
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,960
Yesterday he exhibited an article published in the Electrical World 11 years ago in which

19
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,120
he predicted not only wireless telephony on a commercial basis, but that it would be possible

20
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,760
to identify the voice of an acquaintance over any distance.

21
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:41,880
That its operator in Hawaii was able to distinguish the voice of an engineer friend at Arlington,

22
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,800
Virginia, was announced by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company as the most marked triumph

23
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:53,040
of its communication by wireless telephone from the Naval radio station at Arlington

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,000
to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, a distance of 4,000 miles.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,520
The inventor, who has won fame by his electrical inventions, dictated this statement yesterday.

26
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,360
The experts carrying out this brilliant experiment are naturally deserving of great credit for

27
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,000
the skill they have shown in perfecting the devices.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,880
These are of two kinds, first, those serving to control transmission, and second, those

29
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,480
magnifying the received impulse.

30
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:27,280
That the control of transmission is perfect is plain to experts, from the fact the Arlington,

31
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,960
Maryland, and Pearl Harbor plants are all inefficient, and that the distance of telephonic

32
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,480
transmission is equal to that of telegraphic transmission.

33
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,960
It is also perfectly apparent that the chief merit of the application lies in the magnification

34
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,640
of the microphonic impulse.

35
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,760
It must not be imagined that we deal here with new discoveries.

36
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,280
The improvement simply concerns the control of the transmitted and the magnification of

37
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,640
the received impulse, but the wireless system is the same.

38
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,760
This can never be changed.

39
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:06,120
That it is practicable to project the human voice not only to a distance of 5,000 miles,

40
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:12,560
but clear across the globe, I demonstrated by experiments in Colorado in 1899.

41
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,480
Among my publications, I would refer to an article in the electrical world of March 5,

42
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,760
1904, but describing really tests I made in 1899.

43
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,680
The facts which I pointed out in the article were of much greater significance than that

44
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,000
of the experiments reported, although this should be taken in a scientific sense, as

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,760
the experiments were simply scientific demonstrations.

46
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,640
I pointed out then that the modulations of the human voice can be reproduced more clearly

47
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,260
through the earth than through wire.

48
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:50,320
It is difficult for the layman to understand, but it is an absolute fact that transmission

49
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,360
through the earth with a proper apparatus is not more difficult than the sending of

50
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,600
a message on a wire strung across a room.

51
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,040
This wonderful property of the planet, that, electrically speaking, is through its very

52
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:08,320
bigness small, is of incalculable significance for the future of mankind.

53
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,960
These tests made between Washington and Honolulu will act as an immense stimulus to wireless

54
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,920
telephony and would be of much more value to the world if the principles of the transmission

55
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,080
were understood, but they are not.

56
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:26,560
Even now, fifteen years after the fundamental principles have been demonstrated and the

57
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,040
possibility shown, there are many experts in the dark.

58
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:37,280
For instance, it is claimed that static disturbances will fatally interfere with the transmission,

59
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,520
while, as a matter of fact, there is no static disturbance possible in properly designed

60
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,600
transmission and receiving circuits.

61
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,720
Quite recently I have described in a patent circuits which are absolutely immune to static

62
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,440
and other interferences, so much so that when a telephone is attached, there is absolute

63
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:03,000
silence, even lightning in the immediate vicinity not producing a click of the diaphragm, while

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,560
in the ordinary telephonic conversation there are all kinds of noises.

65
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,240
Transmission without static interference has many wonderful properties besides, first of

66
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:19,320
which is that unlimited amounts of power can be transmitted with very small loss.

67
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:24,160
Another contention is that there can be no secrecy in wireless telephone conversation.

68
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,840
I say it is absurd to raise this contention when it is positively demonstrated by experiments

69
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,040
that the earth is more suitable for transmission than any wire could ever be.

70
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,800
A wireless telephone conversation can be made as secret as thought.

71
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,600
I have myself erected a plant for the purpose of connecting by wireless telephone the chief

72
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:50,320
centers of the world, and from this plant, as many as a hundred, will be able to talk

73
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,800
absolutely without interference and with absolute secrecy.

74
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,120
This plant would simply be connected with a telephone central exchange of New York City,

75
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,920
and any subscriber will be able to talk to any other telephone subscriber in the world,

76
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,400
and all this without any change in the apparatus.

77
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,360
This plan has been called my world system.

78
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:18,560
By the same means, I propose also to transmit pictures and project images so that the subscriber

79
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,600
will not only hear the voice, but see the person to whom he is talking.

80
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,760
Pictures transmitted over wires is a perfectly simple art practiced today.

81
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:34,720
Many inventors have labored on it, but the chief credit is due Professor Korn of Munich.

82
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,840
His apparatus can be attached to a wireless plant, and at any other wireless plant can

83
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,440
be reproduced.

84
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,220
I have undertaken this in the hope of establishing a service which would greatly facilitate the

85
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,840
work of the press.

86
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,700
A picture could be sent from a battlefield in Europe to New York in five minutes if the

87
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,520
proper instruments were available.

88
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,080
A further advantage would be that transmission is instant and free of the unavoidable delay

89
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,480
experienced with the use of wires and cables.

90
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,880
As I have already made known, the current passes through the earth, starting from the

91
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,080
transmission station with infinite speed, slowing down to the speed of light at a distance

92
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,880
of 6,000 miles, then increasing in speed from that region, and reaching the receiving station

93
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,960
again with infinite velocity.

94
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,160
It's all a wonderful thing.

95
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,520
Wireless is coming to mankind in its full meaning like a hurricane some of these days.

96
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:36,120
Some day there will be, say, six great wireless telephone stations in a world system connecting

97
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:42,080
all the inhabitants on this earth to one another, not only by voice, but by sight.

98
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,240
It's surely coming.

99
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,940
End of Nikola Tesla sees a wireless vision by Anonymous, The New York Times, 3rd October

100
00:07:50,940 --> 00:08:13,840
1915.
